class LongEdgeJoiner(ILayoutProcessor):
    """
    Removes dummy nodes due to edge splitting (dummy nodes that have the node type
    {@link NodeType#LONG_EDGE}). If an edge is split into a
    chain of edges <i>e1, e2, ..., ek</i>, the first edge <i>e1</i> is retained, while the other
    edges <i>e2, ..., ek</i> are discarded. This fact should be respected by all processors that
    create dummy nodes: they should always put the original edge as first edge in the chain of edges,
    so the original edge is restored.

    The actual implementation that joins long edges is provided by this class as a public utility method
    to be used by other processors.

      Preconditions:
        a layered graph
        nodes are placed
        edges are routed.
      Postconditions:
        there are no dummy nodes of type {@link NodeType#LONG_EDGE} in the graph's layers.
        the dummy nodes' {@link LNode#getLayer() layer} fields 
            have <strong>not</strong> been set to {@code null} though.
      Slots:
        After phase 5.
      Same-slot dependencies:
